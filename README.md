## Code Blocks Make Me Happy


Here's a JavaScript code snippet for solving second degree quadratic equations
```javascript
/**
 * Solves quadratic ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) with Po-Shen method
 * @param {Number} a quadratic coefficient
 * @param {Number} b linear coefficient
 * @param {Number} c constant 
 */
function quadratic(a, b, c) {
  const denominator = a;
  let sum = -b;
  let halfSum = sum / 2;
  let constant = c;

  if (denominator !== 1) {
    sum /= denominator;
    halfSum = sum / 2;
    constant /= denominator;
  }

  const square = halfSum ** 2;
  const equ = square - constant;
  const rootEqu = Math.sqrt(equ);

  const ansPos = halfSum + rootEqu;
  const ansNeg = halfSum - rootEqu;

  return { "positive": ansPos, "negative": ansNeg };
}
```

Here's the bash command for generating a RSA2048 key pair that expires after a year.
```bash
user=$(whoami)
openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout "$user".key -out "$user"-cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```
